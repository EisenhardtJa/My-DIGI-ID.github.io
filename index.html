SSI â€“ Digital Identity (Hotel Check-In)
The hotel check-in use case shall enable travelers to digitally check-in to a hotel by presenting two credentials to the hotel. The application covers both the issuing services required to issue the credential to the traveler, as well as the verification application used by hotels to check in the guest.

Introduction
With this application a company can issue verifiable corporate credentials to their employees that certify that this employee is working for the respective company. Also, hotels (representing the verifier) can request two credentials from a wallet app (not part of this repository) in order to get the data. Based on the data from the two credentials a digital registration form can be created as well as the guest can be checked in.
